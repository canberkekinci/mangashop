                Years have passed since Naruto and Sasuke teamed up to defeat Kaguya, the progenitor of chakra and the greatest threat the ninja world has ever faced. Times are now peaceful and the new generation of shinobi has not experienced the same hardships as its parents. Perhaps that is why Boruto would rather play video games than train. However, one passion does burn deep in this ninja boy’s heart, and that is the desire to defeat his father!

                "Hanako-san, Hanako-san...are you there?" At Kamome Academy, rumors abound about the school's Seven Mysteries, one of which is Hanako-san. Said to occupy the third stall of the third floor girls' bathroom in the old school building, Hanako-san grants any wish when summoned. Nene Yashiro, an occult-loving high school girl who dreams of romance, ventures into this haunted bathroom...but the Hanako-san she meets there is nothing like she imagined! Kamome Academy's Hanako-san...is a boy!

                When an introverted male student meets a sadistic freshman girl named Nagatoro, his life is turned upside down. She first quietly observes his reaction to verbal abuse from some other high-school girls that are not well-meaning, realizes that oddly enough in his case it may be exactly what he needs, and so begins a sequence of her teasing him. It soon becomes increasingly obvious (to the reader, not to him) that her teasing is actually sardonic, well-intentioned, and flirtatious, in between the bullying and teasing, something else begins to blossom. A lovey-dovey(…?) story between a shy nerd and an S-Dere (Sadistic Tsundere) begins.
